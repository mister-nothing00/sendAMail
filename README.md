# ✉️ Send a Mail

**Send a Mail** is a project that allowed me to deepen the development of **web apps**, applying **best practices** and improving my **technical skills**. The main goal is to allow users to send and receive **password reset emails**, with **registration, login and logout** features.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

The project was developed using the **MERN** stack:

🔹 **MongoDB** → NoSQL database for storing users and credentials
🔹 **Express.js** → Node.js framework used to handle APIs and HTTP requests
🔹 **React** → JavaScript library for creating the user interface
🔹 **Node.js** → JavaScript runtime to execute server-side code
🔹 **react-hot-toast** → Library for real-time notifications (registration, login, password reset)

## ✨ Features

✔️ **Registration and Login** → Users can register and authenticate with real-time feedback
✔️ **Password Reset Password** → Ability to reset password and update it in database
✔️ **Real Time Notifications** → Use of `react-hot-toast` to show success or error messages
✔️ **Send Reset Email** → Implement logic to send password reset email

---

## 📌 Notes

📌 The project is a **prototype** with email sending logic implemented, but may require an external SMTP service to handle real emails.
